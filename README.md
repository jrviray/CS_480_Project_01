# RBTreeVisualization
## Project Requirement

One of my favorite classes to teach is CS 241: Data Structures II. In this class, I teach the concept of a self-balancing tree, and in particular, that of a Red-black tree. When I present these structures in class, I use illustrations on the board to discuss them, but I would LOVE to have a program that provide a graphical illustration of the trees, with animations that show how they change as values are added and removed.

The requirements for this project are:

* 1.The program is very simple, upon opening the program presents an empty window, waiting for values.
* 2.Only integers can be added to the tree.
* 3.The program provides the capability to specify the next value to be added, and the option to add it. Upon adding a value, the value is shown as being added to the correct position, and if an invariant is broken, it will specify which invariant. In the case that an invariant is broken, it will then give the option to trigger the 'fix' and an animation is triggered that shows the correct rotations and re-colorings, yielding the final tree. A similar process should follow when removing a value.
* 4.At any time, there should be an option to save the current tree into a file, and to load a tree from a save previously created.
